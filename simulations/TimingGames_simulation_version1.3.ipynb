    "In this file, there are three cells: 'define functions', 'simulation', 'graphing' cell. \n",
    "- First, run the 'define functions' cell to define functions.\n",
    "- After you run 'define functions' cell, you will see 'config parameters' section explains the parameters you can change in the next cell ('simulation' cell).\n",
    "- After you modify parameters, run the 'simulation' cell. You will see '-------Simulation Start----------',..., until'----------Simulation Finished---------', meaning simulation completed. The processing time depends on the game length you select.\n",
    "- Finally, run the 'graphing' cell. The result shows dynamics graphs over periods. The top left graph shows payoffs for each strategies over periods and green triangle shows which player gets the chance to move; The top right graph shows cdf; the bottom graph shows strategies over periods. "
